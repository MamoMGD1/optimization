# 🏥 Optimal Hospital Placement Algorithm 🏙️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **10x10 city grid** where houses and hospitals are placed strategically to minimize the total distance cost for citizens needing medical care. The goal is to **find the optimal hospital locations** to ensure the shortest possible travel distance for all houses.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The city is randomly generated with **houses** scattered across the grid.
- **Hospitals** can be manually placed or generated at random positions.
- The algorithm **optimizes hospital locations** using **local search heuristics** to find a near-optimal or globally optimal solution.
- Two main functionalities:
  1. **Local Optimization** 🔄 - Improves the current hospital locations by shifting them to lower-cost positions.
  2. **Global Search** 🌍 - Randomizes hospital placements and attempts to reach the **global minimum total cost**.

## 📒 How to Use
1. **Click** on a tile to add/remove a hospital.
2. **Right-click** on a tile to add/remove a house.
3. Press the **Local Opt.** 🔄 button to adjust hospital locations for minimal cost.
4. Press the **Global Opt.** 🚀 button to restart hospitals in random places and search for an even better solution (if possible).

## 🔬 Future Improvements
🚀 Implement **Genetic Algorithms** for better optimization 🔍
🚀 Add different **distance weight factors** for varying priority zones ⚖️
🚀 Expand the grid size dynamically 📏
🚀 Improve visualization with heatmaps 🌡️
